<p> The website you are currently viewing was built by me. It is created to be simple and easy to update, so it can be added to and easily changed or further customized over time. Please view my more complex projects below, however, to fully view what else I am capable of creating.</p>

    <p>Final project for CTEC 3350. The goal was to create a modern minimalist veterinan's buisness website to provide information to new and established clients as well as to attempt to boost sales of the fictional clinics pet clothing. The target audience included people of all age groups (but mainly focused on busy parents and the elderly), so the design is made to be inviting to all, as well as open, bold, and highly easy to navigate.</p>

    <p>This website is made purely with HTML and CSS as a mockup, there are no database features.</p>

Project for CTEC 4321 where PHP and SQL were used to create a functioning application for an actual buisness. I was able to contact Lashes and Locks Beauty Lounge in Burleson, which is a small beauty salon. I used data and information from them to determine the target audience and what features would be most useful to their buisness. For this assignment, a scheduling, directory, and services area were developed for potential clients to view, while an admin area allowed access to view appointments and edit services offered. The overall design is meant to evoke a feeling of comfort and being at home, while still being luxurious or fancy.</p>

<p>As Lashes and Locks already has an updated website, this website exists purely to display a possible design scheme and to demonstrate PHP/SQL application possibilities. Many thanks to Stacy Rattan, the owner of Lashes and Locks, for working with me.</p>

<p>View the website <a href="http://ctec4321.hms2193.uta.cloud/Term%20Assgn/home.php" target="_blank">here</a> and test it out.</p>

<p>The username is ctec and the password is 4321. Please use caution and be kind when using the administrative services and inserting appointments into the system.</p></div>

    <p>Term project for CTEC 4309 completed with project partner, Nicholas Malone, to redesign and create a mock-up of the website of an actual buisness. We contacted the Irving Fire Foundation and were able to redesign their website. The project utilizes PHP, HTML, and CSS, and focuses on enhancing usability and SEO of the website. Our goals were to reorganize the website content to enhance usability, show proper appreciation for scholars and firefighters, and provide easier means of accessing scholarship applications and other site functions. We aim to build trust and encourage the user to donate, apply, or engage while honoring the Irving firefighters and supporting scholarship goals.

    <p>The overall design is meant to be functional and informational, while still being easy to view and navigate for both students and parents.</p>
